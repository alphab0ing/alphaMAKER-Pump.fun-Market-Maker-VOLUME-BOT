  <h2>How It Works</h2>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/alphaMakerMainMenu.png" alt="mainMenu" style="width: 50%;">
  </div>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Set your Token CA</strong>: Enter the token address for the chart the bot will be working on.</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/alphaMakerSettingsMenu.png" alt="settingsMenu" style="width: 50%;">
  </div>
  <ol start="2">
    <li><strong>Choose Your Settings</strong>: Set your primary settings. Each maker wallet is funded and then assigned a batch of additional warm wallets for the trading process. The bot will make transactions at + or - 15% of your set buy amount and will hold the tokens for a period of time randomly selected within your defined buy cycle.</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/alphaMaker-FundWallets.png" alt="fundsWallets" style="width: 50%;">
  </div>
  <ol start="3">
    <li><strong>Fund Wallets</strong>: The bot will automatically determine the minimum deposit necessary based on your settings, any additional funds deposited beyond the minimum buy amount is recommended and will be divided and distributed between your makers.</li>
    <li><strong>Run</strong>: BOOST Your chart, add new holders and generate organic volume which will automatically draw attention to your token; pause or adjust your settings at any time.</li>
  </ol>
  <div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/alphaMaker-RecoverFunds.png" alt="recoverFunds" style="width: 50%;">
  </div>
  <ol start="5">
    <li><strong>Recover</strong>: When finished you simply withdraw any remaining SOL/tokens, minus cost and txn fees.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Cost</h2>
  <p>Costs below are based on the amount of SOL used to fund the wallets, this covers all the makers and additional warm wallets that are assigned to the user from the moment they are funded and remain assigned to that user until funds have been removed and the wallets verified as empty.</p>
  <h3>Fund with 0.25 SOL or less: Cost 0.15 SOL</h3>
  <h3>Fund with 0.75 SOL or less: Cost 0.30 SOL</h3>
  <h3>More than 0.75 SOL: Cost 0.40 SOL</h3>
  <p class="note">Note: Once the initial cost has been deduced from your deposit amount the only other charges/costs from that point forward will be entirely txn fees / gas fees.</p>

  <h2>Multi-bot Larger Scale Projects</h2>
  <p>For LARGE Scale Volume it‚Äôs NEVER been easier and more customizable, you can set exactly how much Volume you want to achieve and in how much time and let alphaTOOLS do the work for you. There‚Äôs 6 alphaMAKER bots currently running on Telegram, each bot is capable of 4-5 transactions per second, if you‚Äôre looking to get a lot of volume in a very short amount of time then running multiple bots is the way to go. Below are some examples of configurations our customers have ran in the past.</p>
  <h3>Example 1</h3>
  <p>User had 3 SOL and wanted Max VOL while running for at least 3 hours:</p>
  <p>Configuration: 3 instances.<br>
  Instance 1: 4 makers, 0.05 SOL, 5‚Äì10s.<br>
  Instance 2: 4 makers, 0.04 SOL, 3‚Äì6s.<br>
  Instance 3: 3 makers, 0.03 SOL, 2‚Äì4s.<br>
  Volume: ~$616,896.</p>
  <p>That‚Äôs accounting for 15% slippage and a 20% chart movement. 600k in 3 hours.</p>
  <h3>Example 2</h3>
  <p>Our first big test, user wanted max Volume for 6 SOL we deposited the 6 SOL into the bots and let them run full speed. After 1hr they generated 2.03 million in volume and the cost to run the bots was 1.5 SOL for bots and 1.34 SOL in transaction fees. The user was able to recover a little over 3 SOL after we finished testing.</p>
  <p>We ran 4 alphaMAKER bots 1-3 SEC. Cycles.<br>
  Generating 15-20 transactions per second</p>
  <p>Transaction Cost $ @ 1-3sec cycles:<br>
  15 min: 0.334125 SOL = $60.14<br>
  30 min: 0.66825 SOL = $120.85<br>
  60 min: 1.3365 SOL = $240.57</p>
  <p>Volume Generated $ @ 1-3sec cycles:<br>
  15 min: 2819.25 SOL = $507,465<br>
  30 minutes: 5638.5 SOL = $1,014,930<br>
  60 minutes: 11277 SOL = $2,029,860</p>
  <p class="note">Note: Slippage and chart movement may affect results, for example on an upward moving chart you can expect to receive better results.</p>
