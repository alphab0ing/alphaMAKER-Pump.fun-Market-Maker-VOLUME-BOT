  <li><strong>Choose Your Settings</strong>: Set your primary settings. Each maker wallet is funded and then assigned a batch of additional warm wallets for the trading process. The bot will make transactions at + or - 15% of your set buy amount and will hold the tokens for a period of time randomly selected within your defined buy cycle.</li>
</ol>
