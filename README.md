alphaMAKER - The Ultimate Market Maker for Solana & Pump.Fun Tokens

Welcome to alphaMAKER, the most advanced market maker and volume bot for the Solana network, designed specifically for pump.fun tokens. Unlike any other bot, alphaMAKER delivers unparalleled performance, customization, and control to boost your token's visibility and trading activity.

Why Choose alphaMAKER?





Realistic Trading Activity: Each maker uses warm wallets with extensive trading histories, indistinguishable from real users. This triggers trending algorithms on DEXs and boosts your token‚Äôs ‚Äúexcitement‚Äù factor.



Scalable Makers: Add as many makers as you need to drive volume and interest in your token.



AI-Powered Customization: Built-in AI reviews your token and tailors settings to your specific needs, with the ability to adjust settings on the fly.



Full Control: Pause, resume, or stop the bot at any time. Recover your funds or tokens whenever you want.



Cost-Effective: Affordable upfront costs, with only transaction/gas fees and slippage after the initial funding. Upward trending charts can even generate profits!



High Performance: Each bot processes up to 4 transactions per second. Run multiple bots to increase transaction speed (e.g., 2 bots for 8 tx/s).

How It Works





Fund Your Makers: Deposit SOL to create warm wallets for trading. The upfront cost depends on your funding amount:





0.25 SOL or less: 0.15 SOL



0.75 SOL or less: 0.30 SOL



More than 0.75 SOL: 0.40 SOL



Customize Settings: Use the AI-driven interface to set buy cycles, amounts, and more, tailored to your token‚Äôs needs.



Run the Bot: Start the bot to generate volume and interest. Pause or adjust settings anytime.



Recover Funds: Withdraw remaining funds or tokens at any time, with only transaction fees deducted.
